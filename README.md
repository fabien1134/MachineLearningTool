Revamp of my final year project originally written in PHP.
This is a machine learning tool.
This application will download messages from a number of platforms such as twitter and Facebook.
Will download targeted negative and positive words and will run a K-means clustering algorithm to see if angry messages will be separated from positive messages using a number of features.
A sentiment analasis algorithm will then be run to separate negative and positive messages.
Groups who wrote negative message will then be able to be identified.
There will be the option to add privacy to participant so only groups of people can be targeted instead of individuals e.g 60% negative messages were by Males or from an area.
A real-world application of this app could be to load a number of messages that customer left and provide the business an idea of what groups of customers have left negative messages.
